# Auditing & Compliance

Tongo provides flexible auditing mechanisms that enable compliance without sacrificing user privacy. Through viewing keys and ex-post proving, regulators can verify transaction details while preserving confidentiality for all other parties.

## Global Auditor

### Concept
The Tongo contract can designate a **global auditor** with public key $y_a$. All transfers are automatically encrypted for this auditor, providing a comprehensive audit trail without revealing amounts on-chain.

### Auditor Encryption
For every transfer of amount $b$, the sender creates three encryptions:
- **Sender**: $(L_s, R) = \text{Enc}[y_s](b, r)$ - subtracted from balance
- **Receiver**: $(L_r, R) = \text{Enc}[y_r](b, r)$ - added to pending
- **Auditor**: $(L_a, R) = \text{Enc}[y_a](b, r)$ - stored for audit

All three use the same blinding factor $r$, proven via Pedersen commitment proofs.

### Multi-Signature Auditing
For enhanced security, auditor keys can be distributed across multiple parties:

$$y_a = g^{a_1 + a_2} = g^{a_1} \cdot g^{a_2} = y_{a_1} \cdot y_{a_2}$$

Individual auditors can compute partial decryptions:
- Auditor 1: $R^{a_1} = (g^r)^{a_1}$ 
- Auditor 2: $R^{a_2} = (g^r)^{a_2}$

The balance is recovered by combining: $g^b = L_a / (R^{a_1} \cdot R^{a_2})$

This prevents any single auditor from unilaterally accessing transaction data.

## Viewing Keys

### Selective Disclosure  
Users can optionally encrypt transfers for additional viewing keys beyond the global auditor:

```rust
struct Transfer {
    // ... other fields ...
    L_opt: Option<Array<(PubKey, StarkPoint)>>, // Additional viewing keys
}
```

Each viewing key $(y_v, L_v)$ represents:
$$L_v = g^b y_v^r$$

The sender proves each additional encryption is correctly formed using Pedersen commitment proofs.

### Use Cases
- **Compliance officers**: Institutional oversight
- **Tax authorities**: Jurisdiction-specific reporting  
- **Internal auditing**: Corporate governance

### Privacy-Preserving Architecture
Viewing keys maintain privacy by:
- Only revealing amounts to authorized parties
- Not exposing transaction values on-chain
- Allowing granular access control per transaction

## Ex-Post Proving

### Motivation
After a transfer is completed, participants may need to prove a specific transaction detail to a third partie without revealing their private keys. Ex-post proving enables this through cryptographic proofs.

### Protocol
Consider a completed transfer with ciphertext $(TL, TR) = (g^{b_0} y^{r_0}, g^{r_0})$. To prove the transfer amount to a third party with public key $\bar{y}$:

#### 1. Revelation Phase
The sender creates new encryptions of the same amount:
- **Sender encryption**: $(L, R) = \text{Enc}[y](b, r)$
- **Third-party encryption**: $(\bar{L}, R) = \text{Enc}[\bar{y}](b, r)$

#### 2. Consistency Proof
The sender proves the new encryptions contain the same amount as the original transfer:

$$\frac{TL}{L} = \left(\frac{TR}{R}\right)^x$$

This equality holds if and only if $b_0 = b$ (the amounts match).

#### 3. Required Proofs
The complete ex-post proof $\pi_{\text{expost}}$ demonstrates:

1. **Ownership**: Knowledge of $x$ such that $y = g^x$ (POE)
2. **Blinding**: Knowledge of $r$ such that $R = g^r$ (POE)  
3. **Sender encryption**: $L = g^b y^r$ (PED)
4. **Third-party encryption**: $\bar{L} = g^b \bar{y}^r$ (PED)
5. **Consistency**: $TL/L = (TR/R)^x$ (POE)

### Mathematical Foundation
The consistency check works because:
$$\frac{TL}{L} = \frac{g^{b_0} y^{r_0}}{g^b y^r} = g^{b_0-b} y^{r_0-r}$$

$$\left(\frac{TR}{R}\right)^x = \left(\frac{g^{r_0}}{g^r}\right)^x = g^{(r_0-r)x} = y^{r_0-r}$$

These are equal only when $b_0 = b$, proving amount consistency.

### Off-Chain Verification
Ex-post proofs require no on-chain interaction:
- Transaction data is retrieved from chain state
- Proofs are generated and verified off-chain
- Only requires the original transaction hash as reference

## Regulatory Compliance

### AML/KYC Integration
Tongo supports various compliance frameworks:

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- Global auditor receives all transaction encryptions
- Automated threshold detection (encrypted amounts)
- Pattern analysis on transaction graphs

#### Selective Disclosure
- Users can voluntarily encrypt for compliance officers
- Jurisdiction-specific reporting requirements  
- Time-limited viewing key access

#### Retroactive Investigation
- Ex-post proving enables transaction reconstruction
- User cooperation required for private key revelation
- Court-ordered disclosure mechanisms

## Advanced Features

### Threshold Auditing
Multiple auditors with threshold decryption:
$$y_a = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot y_{a_i}$$

Where $w_i$ are threshold weights and $t$ out of $n$ auditors are required for decryption.

### Zero-Knowledge Compliance
Prove compliance properties without revealing amounts:
- **Range compliance**: Prove transfer amount below threshold
- **Velocity limits**: Prove cumulative amounts within bounds
- **Whitelist compliance**: Prove recipient authorization

These advanced features demonstrate Tongo's flexibility in balancing privacy and regulatory requirements across diverse jurisdictions and use cases.
